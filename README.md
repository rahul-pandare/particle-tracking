# particle-tracking
Identifying particle positions and sizes using convolution by least square fitting (Chi-squared method)

This repository contains files on particle tracking using convolution by chi-squared minimization. 
input movie: particle_movie.mp4
Particle tracking algorithm: particletracking_.m
function files: chiimg.m, clip.m, ipf.m & findpeaks.m

NOTE:
The algorithm is written in MATLAB. the function files are required to be in the working directory for the algorithm to execute.
